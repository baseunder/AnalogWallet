# 3D Case

## Introduction
You can protect your wallet by printing a case around your hardware.

## Requirements
* Filament 3D Printer

## How to start
Load the case-Cube.stl into your 3D Slicer, add a PAUSE command just before the top layer begins.
Print the part and wait until the PAUSE is reached, then put your hardware wallet into the semi finisted print.
Now exit the PAUSE and continue with the print. Your printer should now close the wallet inside a solid block of molten plastic.

## How to continue
If you see any improvements you can simply open the "case.blend" file inside Blender (https://www.blender.org/) and add make your modifications.
